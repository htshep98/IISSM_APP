# IISSM_APP 
\
IISSM-APP download files and the code used to produce the app.

## Aims
This app is aimed at undergraduate geography students to experiment with the Infinite Slope Stability Model (ISSM).\
The app has three main goals:\
G1: Understand how changes in variables affect the factor of safety.\
G2: Given the physical conditions of different slopes, understand how and why the factor of safety
may vary.\
G3: Begin to understand some of the faults and limitations of the model.

## Files
The IISSM-APP and its associated functions were created on MATLAB 2022a.\
The following files can be downloaded from this repository:\
#### Downloads
X.mlappinstall is the download file for the app to be used on MATLAB. This file can only be accessed through MATLAB. If you would like to use this version of the app, please first download MATLAB and open the file through the 'Apps' tab.\
Y.exe is the download file for the app to be used as a desktop app. It can be downloaded by anyone using a desktop computer. To use this version of the app simply install and open. The app will run on opening.\
#### Code
Z.m is the code used to produce the app as an .m file. It can be opened through MATLAB (or equivalent).\
infslopem.m is the ISSM function created for use in the app. It can be downloaded and edited.

## Usage
Feel free to download and use the app, and download and edit the code, for example to include further parameters (e.g. by modelling cohesion or saturation).\
If, upon download, you spot any bugs or have any other feedback, please email:\
